# CSL1011: Implement `params` collection.

(This feature is not available in .NET Framework or .NET Standard 2.0 and below.)

In C# 13 one can use a collection type instead of an array for open parameters in a method.

```cs
// Before
public void Foo<T>(params T[] items)
{
}

// After
using System;

public void Foo<T>(params ReadOnlySpan<T> items)
{
}
```

The benefits of this change is a better handling of `null` for the parameter, and performance.

By replacing `params params T[]` with `params ReadOnlySpan<T>` one ensures `null` is not a concern anymore, since `ReadOnlySpan<T>` is a `ref struct`, and the burden of the check is moved to the caller.

If the method must not be changed because it's a public API, create an override using `params ReadOnlySpan<T>`, and unify the two methods. The compiler will choose the best override seamlessly.

Diagnostic CSL1011 is emitted under the following conditions:

- The `params` parameter is an array.
- The method does not already have an override with `params ReadOnlySpan<T>`.
- This parameter is used in the method.

## Sample code

```cs
public static int Foo<T>(params T[] items) // CSL1011: Implement params collection.
{
    return items.Length;
}
```
