# CSL1010: 'init' accessor not supported in FieldBackedPropertyAttribute.

The `FieldBackedProperty` attribute cannot be used with a property that has an `init` accessor. Since the `init` accessor is used to initialize, and after that client can only call a value, the property doesn't need a backing field. One can use an auto property.

## Sample code

```cs
[FieldBackedProperty] // CSL1010: 'init' accessor not supported in FieldBackedPropertyAttribute.
public partial int Foo { get; init; }
```
