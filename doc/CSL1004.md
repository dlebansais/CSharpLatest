# CSL1004 Consider using records to simplify your code.

Feature available since C# 9: [records](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/record)

## Sample code

Before:
```cs
class NamedItem
{
    public NamedItem(string name)
    {
        Name = name;
    }

    public string Name { get; }
}
```

After:
```cs
record NamedItem(string Name);
```

Note: if a record is not appropriate, and you are using C# 12 or later, consider using a primary constructor (see [CSL1003](./CSL1003.md)).
