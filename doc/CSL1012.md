# CSL1012: Use `System.Threading.Lock` to lock.

(This feature is available starting in .NET 9.)

In most situations it is recommended to use an instance of `System.Threading.Lock` in a `lock` instruction. However, this diagnostic won't be emitted if the lock object type is defined within the assembly, to not interfere with custom lock types.

## Sample code

```cs

private readonly object _lockObj = new();

lock (_lockObj) // CSL1012: Use System.Threading.Lock to lock.
{
}
```
