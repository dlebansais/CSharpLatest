# CSL1007: Add missing braces

(The description of this rule also covers [CSL1008: Remove unnecessary braces](CSL1008.md))

CSL1007 and CSL1008 rules enhance the [IDE0011](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/style-rules/ide0011) rule with additional options.

To recall, `csharp_prefer_braces` in the `.editorconfig` file can be used to control the use of braces:

| Value          | Description                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| true           | Prefer curly braces even for one line of code. |
| false          | Prefer no curly braces if allowed.             |
| when_multiline | Prefer curly braces on multiple lines.         |

With `true` the default value. The `false` value is misleading, it's actually implemented as "don't care, never report the diagnostic".

**CSL1007** and **CSL1008** use the same semantic, but also support the following values:

| Value          | Description                                                                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| never          | Same as `false` but require no curly braces if allowed.                     |
| recursive      | Same as `when_multiline` but each statement can be on one line recursively. |

## Sample code

With `csharp_prefer_braces` set to `false`, the following is allowed.
```cs
class Test
{
    int Foo(int n)
    {
        if (n > 0)
        {
            return 1;
        }
        else
            return 0;
    }
}
```

To enforce no braces (when allowed, it's obviously disallowed for empty blocks), use `never`:
```cs
class Test
{
    int Foo(int n)
    {
        if (n > 0) // CSL1008: Remove unnecessary braces from 'if' statement.
        {
            return 1;
        }
        else
            return 0;
    }
}
```
